GitHub and GitHub Actions
This project was managed using GitHub for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

GitHub Actions:
Using GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process. 
This includes:

•	Running automated tests to ensure the app’s functionality.
•	Compiling the app into APK and AAB files, which are the formats required for distribution.
•	Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.
•	The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final 

Video Demo:
