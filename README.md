GitHub and GitHub Actions
This project was managed using GitHub for version control, where all code changes were committed and pushed regularly. GitHub enabled collaborative coding, allowing me to keep track of changes and maintain project integrity.

GitHub Actions:
Using GitHub Actions to automate the build and deployment process. 
This includes:

•	Running automated tests to ensure the app’s functionality.
•	Compiling the app into APK and AAB files, which are the formats required for distribution.
•	Uploading these build artifacts to GitHub for easy access.
•	The workflow ensures that my project is automatically built and tested every time I push changes, and it simplifies the process of delivering the final 

Video Demo:

CHALLENGES & LEARNING
During the development of this app, I have faced many challenges including:

1.	CHALLENGE 1: was trying to run my Virtual Machine

SOLUTION: asked the school to help out

2.	CHALLENGE 2: finding the right code to use and how to use it

SOLUTION: used the subject’s module manual and some of sir’s codes to gain understanding.

3.	CHALLENGE 3: trying to link my screens together

SOLUTION: researched on how to do so

4.	CHALLENGE 4: running my app on the Virtual Machine

SOLUTION: had to delete the virtual devices and create another one

5.	CHALLENGE 5: fully running my app without crushing 

SOLUTION: was unable to solve it fully
